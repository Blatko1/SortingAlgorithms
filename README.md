# Sorting Algorithm Examples

This repository is created for practicing my programming skills in C and writing some popular sorting algorithms in C. 
If you see some bad code feel free to **Fork** or create a **New Issue**.


## Sorting Algorithms in the Project:

- QuickSort - great resources for understanding this algorithm are [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting) for visualizing algorithms and a book [C Programming: A Modern Approach](http://knking.com/books/c/)
- Bubble Sort - the most simple sorting algorithm.

### Algorithms that will be added:

- Selection Sort
